# A Book's Word Frequency
This was a class project from the fall semester. 
The project reads through a given file, mine was The Hounds of the Baskervilles, to then adjust the file to be easier to perform 
sentiment analysis on, without any imported modules. 
Going through the file, I compared the number of positive words in a sentence to the number of negative words. 
If there were more sentiments in a sentence than another, the sentence would be that sentiment. 
The sentence would be neutral if they were equal in sentiments. 
This project prints out the total number of sentences that are positive, negative, and neutral.
